Draught Kings README
Last Updated: 3/12/17



The game Draught Kings will be contained within a JAR file, which the users will be able to download from our Github repository.
This file will then be placed into a folder of the user's choosing and can be run simply by double clicking it.

Upon starting the game the game will lead the user through a series of questions in order to setup the user as either a host or a client.
Once the user selects their roles and finializes any questions afterwards, then the gameboard will appear and populate with checkers pieces.

The host is always red, and the client is always black. At this point the match may begin.
Moves are made when a player uses their mouse to select one of their pieces, and then clicks again to a valid move location.
The match ends and both users' board windows will close when one player's pieces are all captured.
If there are pieces still on the board but no moves can be made (as in the case of checker pieces reaching the opposite end of the board),
at this time the players will have to manually close the game windows and quit the game.
